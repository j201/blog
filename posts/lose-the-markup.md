JS frameworks are moving in two directions these days. On one side, you have a push to make HTML documents capable of representing the kinds of complex elements that are used in web applications. Angular, Knockout, Polymer, and Web Components all subscribe to this approach. On the other side, you have frameworks that give up on markup templates and represent UIs programmatically. This camp includes React, Mercury, Mithril, and Elm.

In my experience, those used to frameworks from the HTML group are disgusted when first seeing JSX or other JS representations of visual elements.
Hopefully I can help dispel some of the [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) around markup-free UIs.
